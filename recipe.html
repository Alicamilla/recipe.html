<h4>Ingredients</h4>

<br>For the Cake:
<ul>
	<li>4 large eggs</li>
	<li>2 cups sugar</li>
	<li>2 cups all purpose flour</li>
	<li>1 cup canola oil</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons baking soda</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
	<li>2 teaspoons ground cinnamon</li>
	<li>3/4 teaspoon salt</li>
	<li>3 cups grated carrots</li>
	<li>1 cup coarsely chopped walnuts or pecans</li>
	<li>1 cup shredded coconut(sweetened or unsweetened)</li>
	<li>1/2 cup moist raisins or dried cranberries</li>
</ul>
<br>For the Frosting:
<ul>
	<li>8 oz cream cheese at room temp</li>
	<li>1 stick (8 tbps) unsalted butter at room temp</li>
	<li>3 (3/4) cups confectioners' sugar</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice or 1/2 teaspoon pure lemon extract</li>
	<li>1/2 cup shredded coconut (optional)</li>
	<li>toasted finely chopped nuts for topping (optional)</li>
<h4>Preparation</h4>
<ol>
	<li>For the cake: Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Butter three 9-inch round, 2-inch deep cake pans,flour the insides and tap out the excess.</li>
	<li>In one bowl, whisk together the flour, cinnamon, baking powder, baking soda and salt. In another bowl, stir the grated carrots,chopped nuts,and coconut and raisins.</li>
	<li>Using an electronic mixer or larger bowl with a whisk, beat together the sugar and oil together until a smooth texture. Add the 4 eggs,one by one and continue to beat on low speed until the mixture is smooth and dry ingredients are mixed in. Then gently mix in the bowl of chunky ingredients.</li>
	<li>Divide the batter among the baking pans. Bake for 40-50 minutes rotating the pans to bottom and front to back at the midpoint.Use a knife or toothpick to check to make sure the cakes are properly baked. Allow the cakes to cool down for 5 minutes then transfer to cooling racks.</li>
	<li>For the frosting: In a mixer, beat the cream cheese and butter until smooth and creamy. Begin to gradually add confectioners' sugar until the frosting is velvety smooth then add in the lemon juice or extract.</li>
	<li>If you choose to put coconut in the filling, scoop out 1/2 of the frosting and stir in the coconut into this portion.</li>
	<li>To frost the cake, place one layer of the cake right-side up, on a cardboard round or cake plate. Use an offset spatula  or spoon the frosting all the way to the edges of the layer. Top with the second layer this time placing the cake top-side down. If you've added coconut to the frosting, use half of coconut frosting to generously cover the first layer. Then frost with the remainder of the coconut frosting. Use the remainder of the frosting to cover the top and sides if you want. It is optional to add any toppings such as nuts or coconuts. Make sure to do so while the frosting is still soft then place into the refridgerator for 15 minutes to set the frosting.</li>
	<li>Serving: The cake is ready to serve as soon as the frosting is set. It is best served in thick slices at room temperature. While it is good plain, you can also serve it with whipped cream, vanilla ice cream or with some lemon curd with whipped cream folded in.</li>
	<li>Storing: The cake can also be frozen,uncovered,and then when it is firmed wrapped airtight and kept in the freezer for up to 2 months; defrost,still wrapped, in the refrigerator overnight.
